[LECODE-PARAMETERS]

# This section defines general LE-CODE parameters. The corresponding options
# have a higher priority. Remove or comment-out a parameter if its value
# should not be changed. All values will be limited to the allowed ranges.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First we define a limitation mode. This mode defines the allowed values for
# the other parameters of this section:
#
#   LE$PRODUCTIVE   : Exclude test and experimental values.
#   LE$TESTING      : Allow test values, but exclude experimental values.
#   LE$EXPERIMENTAL : Allow all values.
#   LE$AUTOMATIC    : Enable automatic detection by analyzing all values.
#
# Values set by an option are never limited. See parameter descriptions for
# limitation details.

LIMIT-MODE	= LE$AUTOMATIC

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# LE-CODE supports cheat codes as sequence of D-Pad keys in combination with
# ALT keys. Here you can define, which type of cheat codes are allowed:
#  0: Almost all cheat codes are disabled.
#  1: Only cheat codes without impact to game play are allowed.
#  2: All cheat codes are allowed. (Not possible if LIMIT-MODE==LE$PRODUCTIVE).

CHEAT-MODE	= 0

# Define probabilities for engine classes. A list for »100cc,150cc,mirror« is
# expected. If 200cc is enabled, the values are for »150cc,200cc,mirror«. Any
# number is accepted. They are normalized to get a total of 100 percent.
# Use »0,1,0« to force 150cc. Use »0,0,0« to reset to Nintendo's VR based
# choice. Option --engine will overrides these settings.

ENGINE		= 10,60,30

# Enable (1) or disable (0) 200cc support. Option --200cc will overrides this
# setting. LE-CODE hasn't implemented this feature yet!

ENABLE-200CC	= 0

# Enable (1) or disable (0) the performance monitor at Wii and Wii U. Enabling
# is only possible if LIMIT-MODE is LE$TESTING or LE$EXPERIMENTAL. The special
# value 2 enables it for Dolphin too, but only on LE$EXPERIMENTAL. It doesn't
# work correctly with Dolphin. Option --perf-mon will overrides this setting.

PERF-MONITOR	= 0

# Enable (1) or disable (0) Time Trial for custom tracks. Option --custom-tt
# will overrides this setting.

CUSTOM-TT	= 0

# Enable (1) or disable (0) support for Extended Presence Flags. Disable it
# only for tests! If LIMIT-MODE==LE$PRODUCTIVE, XPFLAGS is always enabled.
# Option --xpflags overrides this setting.

XPFLAGS		= 1

# Define the number of races that a previously used track is blocked. LE-CODE
# will try to find another possible track among the selected tracks. Values
# between 0 (deactivated at all) and 50 are allowed. Chat messages can clear
# the track list and enable or disable this feature.

BLOCK-TRACK	= 0

# Enables (SPEEDO$0 .. SPPEDO$3) or disables (SPEEDO$OFF) the speedometer.
# If enabled, the speedometer is displayed at bottom right of the screen
# using format »123.123 km/h«. The digit behind SPEEDO$ defines the number
# of fraction digits.
# Option --speedometer overrides this setting.

SPEEDOMETER	= SPEEDO$OFF

# Define a debug mode. Debug output is displayed below the speedometer. It is
# defined by sections [DEBUG-*]. This parameter defines the general behaviour.
# Possible values are DEBUG$OFF, DEBUG$ENABLED and DEBUG$1 to DEBUG$4.
# DEBUG$OFF disables the debug output at all. All other values enable debug
# output and define the start configuration.
# Option --debug overrides this setting.

DEBUG		= DEBUG$OFF

# Enable (1) or disable (0) built-in item cheat.

ITEM-CHEAT	= 0

# Allow (1) or forbid (0) players to drag blue shells behind them.
# LE-CODE default is 1.

DRAG-BLUE-SHELL	= 1

# Define the time in frames a player is small after being struck by a
# thundercloud. Only values between 1 and 32767 (0x7fff) are accepted.
# MKW uses 612 (10.2s) and LE-CODE default is 300 (5.0s).

THCLOUD-TIME	= 300 # 5.00s

# Since build 36, LE-CODE supports worldwide matches. Here you can disable (0)
# or enable (1) it for battle or versus. The online "worldwide" button is
# disabled, if both settings are disabled.

BT-WORLDWIDE	= LE$DISABLE
VS-WORLDWIDE	= LE$DISABLE

# Since build 34, LE-CODE supports texture hacks for original Nintendo tracks
# and arenas. This new feature can be disabled by value LE$DISABLE (default)
# or enabled by value LE$ENABLE. Additonally you can append »|LE$ALTERABLE«
# to allow the user to enable or disable this feature by controller cheat
# codes. Append »|LE$EXCLUDE« to exclude the original track from the random
# selection.

BT-TEXTURES	= LE$DISABLE
VS-TEXTURES	= LE$DISABLE

# Disable (0) or enable (1) the blocking of recent texture hacks. If disabled
# all online players select always the same texture variant. If enabled, then
# a texture variant will be blocked for the next 3 races. However, this has
# the disadvantage that players with different pasts may select different
# variants. But this should go away after a few races.

BLOCK-TEXTURES	= 1

# LE-CODE usually (0) overwrites the table that determines the distribution of
# points in private races. Nintendo has defined values between 0 and 15 in
# StaticR.rel, LE-CODE defines values between 1 and 25. If this parameter is
# set to 1, then the values are read from StaticR.rel.

STATICR-POINTS	= 0

[CHAT-MESSAGE-MODES]

# LE-CODE supports a special feature for chat messages in private rooms. If a
# message is send by the host and at least one guest is present, then some
# messages change the behavior of the game. This section defines the special
# function.

# The first parameter resets all message to CHAT$OFF (no function).
# The default is value 1. If set to 0, the current map is edited.
@reset = 1

# Set the value to 1 if you want to use the old behavior defined for MKW-Fun.
@legacy = 0

# And now define the functions for different chat messages. The syntax is:
#
#	MESSAGE '=' EXPRESSION1
#	MESSAGE '=' EXPRESSION1 ',' EXPRESSION2
#
# MESSAGE is the letter 'M' followed by a number between 1 and 96. Examples
# are M1, M02, M96. EXPRESSION is any expression supported by the parser.
# Up to 2 modes (separated by a comma) can be defined for each message.
# Usually the following constants or functions are used:
#
#   CHAT$TRACK_BY_HOST : The host selects a tracks and wins the lottery.
#                        The track selection for guests is disabled. 
#   CHAT$ANY_TRACK     : Cancel CHAT$TRACK_BY_HOST.
#
#   CHAT$BLOCK_CLEAR   : Clear the used-tracks list.
#   CHAT$BLOCK_DISABLE : Disable the block-track functionality.
#   CHAT$BLOCK_ENABLE  : Enable the block-track functionality. This is the
#                        default, but have only impact, if BLOCK-TRACK > 0.
#
#   CHAT$KARTS_ONLY    : Each player must select a kart.
#   CHAT$BIKES_ONLY    : Each player must select a bike.
#   CHAT$ANY_VEHICLE   : Cancel vehicle requirement.
#
#   CHAT$USE_ENGINE_1  : Select first engine class  (100cc or 150cc if 200cc enabled)
#   CHAT$USE_ENGINE_2  : Select second engine class (150cc or 200cc if 200cc enabled)
#   CHAT$USE_ENGINE_3  : Select third engine class  (mirror)
#   CHAT$RESET_ENGINE  : Cancel engine selection.
#
#   chat$n_races(N)    : Define the number of races in the next Grand Prix.
#                        N is a number between 1 and 512 (inclusive). 
#
#   chat$vehicle(...)  : Define a chat modus for a vehicle group. 0 to N values
#                        are expected as function parameters. Each parameter is
#                        either from the group VEH$SMALL, VEH$MEDIUM, VEH$LARGE
#                        and VEH$ANY_SIZE for size selections and/or from the
#                        group VEH$KART, VEH$BIKE, VEH$ANY_TYPE for type
#                        selections. VEH$ANY resets the limitations.
#
#   CHAT$RESET         : Reset all settings to their defaults.
#
# See https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/LE-CODE/Distribution_Tutorial#chatmsg
# for more details.
#
# Examples:
#   M01 = CHAT$TRACK_BY_HOST
#   M96 = chat$n_races(15), CHAT$USE_ENGINE_2

[DEBUG-DOCU]
# This section is documentation only and has no impact!

# If the general parameter DEBUG (see section [LECODE-PARAMETERS]) is set to
# a value ≥1, then additional information is added below the speed (even if
# speedometer is disabled). The intention is to debug tracks.

# 4 debug displays with up to 10 lines each can be defined.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# SETUP = DEBUG$...
# Usually, a debug section is edited, so that not specified parameters are
# not modified (same as DEBUG$OFF). With SETUP a section can be initialized:
#
#  DEBUG$OFF      : Do nothing.
#  DEBUG$CLEAR    : Clear all data.
#
#  DEBUG$STANDARD : Use a standard debug line for the player.
#  DEBUG$OPPONENT : Use a standard debug line for the player and one more line
#		    for the first opponent.
#  DEBUG$VERTICAL : Arrange the output vertically for the player.

# HIDE-SPEEDO = 0 | 1
# This global command is independent from lines. If set and this configuration
# becomes active, then hide the speedometer. This helps if many elements are
# active. Otherwise a smaller font is selected by the system. 
    
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# LINE = -1 | 0..9
# Select a line. All following commands until the next LINE command disable or
# enable the output for the current line. Lines are numbered from 0 to 9. If
# an invalid index is entered, the following commands are ignored. So set
# LINE=-1 to disable a complete line. 

# ENABLED = 0|1
# ENABLED defines, if the current lines becomes active. If set to 0 or if all
# other parts are disabled, then the debug line is not printed. So you can
# disable a line without changing the other parameters.

# OPPONENT = 0|1
# Usually the data of the current player is printed (font color yellow). If
# OPPONENT is enabled, then print the data of the first opponent and use a
# blue font color as indicator. 

# SPACE = 0|1
# Usually the lines are separated by a line terminator (line feed). If SPACE
# is set, then a space is used instead, so that the previous and the current
# line are displayed in one visual line. 

# POSITION = 0|1
#   Output: P=x,y,z
# If enabled then print the current position (x, y and z coordinates) of the
# player. Coordinates outside the range ±131071 (see Item position bug) are
# highlighted by an orange font, or a white font it the position is fixed by
# LEX ITEM-POS-FACTOR.

# CHECK-POINT = 0..3
#   Output: CK=c   |   CK=c,k   |   CK=c,k^m
# If enabled print a check point info. The mode defines how many parts are
# printed. 'c' is the current check point. 'k' is the last relevant key check
# point. 'm' is the highest reached key check point in the current lap. If
# driving backwards, 'k' is decreased, but 'm' not. 

# RESPAWN = 0|1
#   Output: R=r
# If enabled then print the respawn index defined by the current check point. 
# This information may help to test all respawn points of a track. 

# ITEM-POINT = 0|1
#   Output: I=i
# If enabled print the current item point index of the player.

# KCL-TYPE = 0|1
#   Output: K=t,v
# If enabled print current KCL type (t=00-1F) and KCL variant (v=000-7FF).

# LAP-POS = 0|1
#   Output: L=lap
# Print the current lap position as floating point value with 3 digits. The
# integer number reflects the current lap number, and the decimal (0.000 to
# 0.999) the progress within the current lap. This number is calculated by
# Mario Kart Wii to compare positions. Together with the opponent view it
# can help to investigate different paths of a track and to place the check
# points at good positions.

# XPF = 0|1|2
#   Output: X:...
# If enabled, a short (1) or long (2) information about the usage of extended
# presence flags is printed, but only if an information is available. The long
# information is similar to the short one, but with more or extended members.
# See https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/LPAR#XPF for details.
